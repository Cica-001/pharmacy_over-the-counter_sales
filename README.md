# Pharmacy Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail pharmacy over-the-counter (OTC) sales data and presents key business insights through an interactive Excel dashboard. The goal is to help pharmacy managers and business owners understand sales performance, identify revenue-driving products and categories, and make informed inventory and sales decisions.

## Business Problem
Retail pharmacies generate large volumes of sales data, but without analysis, it is difficult to answer key questions such as:
- How is the pharmacy performing overall?
- Which products and categories generate the most revenue?
- How do sales change over time?
- What products should be prioritized for stocking?
- How do customers prefer to pay?

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw transactional data into actionable business insights.
